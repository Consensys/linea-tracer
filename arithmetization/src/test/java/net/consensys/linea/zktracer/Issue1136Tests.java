/**
 * This test contains a STATICCALL to the ECRECOVER precompile in the first transaction, at
 * HUB_STAMP = 1187 (before update). This call is special and we should extract several unit tests
 * from it.
 *
 * <p>At the time of the STATICCALL the context owns 3124 gas. With no value transfer (and hence no
 * account creation) and (I believe) no memory expansion the net upfront gas cost of this STATICCALL
 * is 100. The current context is therefore left with 3024 gas after having paid for the upfront gas
 * cost. The STATICCALL allows the transfer of all its GAS (=3124) to the child context. That is: it
 * allows it to transfer (after upfronts costs) all 3024 remaing units of gas.
 *
 * <p>However, the (63/64)-ths rule kicks in and the child may only receive 3024 - (3024/64) = 3024
 * - 47 = 2977 to its child. With the cost of ECRECOVER being set at 3000 ECRECOVER fails in the
 * only way it knows how to and we are left with a 0 on the stack.
