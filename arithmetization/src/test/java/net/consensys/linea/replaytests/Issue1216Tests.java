  /**
   * When constructing the "before" {@link AccountSnapshot} of the recipient account (i.e. the heir
   * of the SELFDESTRUCT) we are using either
   *
   * <p>(1) {@link AccountSnapshot#canonical(Hub, Address)} of the (trimmed) recipient address or
   *
   * <p>(2) {@link AccountSnapshot#deepCopy()} of the "after" version of the self destructor.
   *
   * <p>The first method the right approach when the (trimmed) recipient address is different from
   * the address of the account undergoing SELFDESTRUCT. The second method has to be used when the
   * two coincide.
   *
   * <p>The issue in the SEPOLIA block 2392659 was that {@link AccountSnapshot#deepCopy()} was
   * blowing up with a NPE since the "after" version of the self destructor didn't exist yet in the
   * code. This was solved in issue #1216.
